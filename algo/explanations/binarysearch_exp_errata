This is a list of corrections to the binarysearch_exp.pdf explanation file. 
In the explanation, search for the text: "is just a more mathematical way of writing ceil(n/2)"
This should be "is just a more mathematical way of writing floor(n/2)"

Similarly, search for the text: "hint: The ceil(x) has a property" 
This should be "hint: The floor(x) has a property"

Sorry for the erroneous typing! I'm currently working on re-drafting the binarysearch_exp.pdf document and will soon 
upload a more correct version.

Thanks for tuning in! 

Best Regards,
Nishant Kelkar
