Welcome! This repository consists of some commonly used algorithms, their explanations and some working (java)code 
to back these explanations. As of 12:38AM 01/16/2014, this repository consists of the following algorithms: 
-- binary search algorithm
-- string encoding algorithm

Note: The above list will be periodically updated. To see the actual list of algorithms included in this folder, see 
./algo/body 

./algo/body --> this is a folder that consists simple text files describing different algorithms in pseudo-code. 
./algo/explanations --> this folder contains pdf files that explain the algorithms in ./algo/body 
./code --> this is a code repository for all algorithms covered in ./algo. To see the actual code for the algorithms, 
navigate to ./code/src/main/java/org/nkelkar/algorithm and locate the package for the algorithm that you are interested 
in. 

Thanks and I hope you enjoy reading about various different algorithms here!
